# Cookie Policy

**Effective Date: December 18, 2025**

## Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how our web-based booking system ("the Service") uses cookies and similar technologies. We are committed to transparency and GDPR compliance.

Cookies are small text files stored on your device to enable functionality and security.

## Cookies We Use

We use **only strictly necessary cookies** (exempt from consent requirements under the ePrivacy Directive and GDPR):

| Cookie Name    | Purpose                                      | Provider   | Duration          | Type      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| csrf_token     | Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks for secure form submissions | First-party | Session (deleted when browser closes) | Essential |

No analytics, advertising, functional, or third-party cookies are used. We do not track users across sites.

## Why We Use Essential Cookies

These cookies are required for:
- Secure authentication and login.
- Protecting forms (e.g., registration, booking).
- Basic site functionality.

Without them, core features like secure booking would not work.

## Managing Cookies

- You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but this will prevent login, registration, and booking.
- No consent banner is required as only essential cookies are used.

## Third-Party Cookies

None are set or used by the Service.

## Changes to This Policy

We will update this policy if we introduce new cookies. Changes will be posted here.
